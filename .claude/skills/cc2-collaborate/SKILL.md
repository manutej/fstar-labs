## The Eternal Function

**Universal Question**: *How do we coordinate?*

This function captures the timeless human activity of coordinating independent efforts toward shared goals. Across all domains and eras, humans work in parallel on different aspects of a problem, then merge results. COLLABORATE is the bridge from "individual work" to "collective achievement."

### Universality Across Domains

| Domain | COLLABORATE Applies To | Core Operation |
|--------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Medicine** | Surgical teams, care coordination, specialist consultation | Coordinate surgeon, anesthesiologist, nurses toward patient outcome |
| **Business** | Department coordination, cross-functional teams, partnerships | Coordinate sales, marketing, product toward revenue goals |
| **Science** | Research collaboration, multi-institution studies, peer review | Coordinate multiple labs toward research publication |
| **Education** | Team teaching, curriculum development, assessment design | Coordinate teachers across subjects toward learning goals |
| **Manufacturing** | Assembly line coordination, supply chain, quality teams | Coordinate production, logistics, QA toward delivery |
| **Software** | Pair programming, code review, microservices orchestration | Coordinate developers, services toward feature delivery |
| **Law** | Legal team coordination, co-counsel, expert witnesses | Coordinate attorneys, paralegals, experts toward case strategy |
| **Architecture** | Design team, engineering coordination, contractor management | Coordinate architects, engineers, contractors toward building |

### The Universal Pattern

```
Independent Work → Parallel Composition → Merged Result
   (Agents)      →   (Applicative)     →   (Outcome)
```

**Historical Precedent**:
- **Ancient Building**: Pyramid construction (coordinated labor - 2560 BCE)
- **Military**: Roman legion coordination (centurions + legates - 100 BCE)
- **Industrial**: Assembly line coordination (1913)
- **Software**: Microservices orchestration (2010s)

The function is eternal; the coordination mechanisms change.

### Why This Works Universally

1. **Applicative Structure**: Independent agents compose via `<*>` operator
2. **Parallel**: Agents work independently, results merge deterministically
3. **Compositional**: Coordination of coordination (meta-collaboration)
4. **Role-based**: Clear agent roles, interfaces, handoffs

Surgical team coordination = Software team coordination. Same structure, different agents.

## When to Use This Skill

- 👥 **Coordinate teams** - Multiple agents working toward shared goal
- ⚡ **Parallel execution** - Independent work that merges
- 🔄 **Role management** - Define agent responsibilities, interfaces
- 📊 **Merge results** - Combine outputs from parallel agents
- 🎯 **Shared context** - All agents work from same base state

## Building Foundations for Your Domain

**Universal Function = Eternal Structure + Domain Foundations**

COLLABORATE is an eternal categorical structure (Applicative + Parallel). To use it in YOUR domain, construct **domain foundations** - agent roles, communication protocols, and merge strategies.

### The Pattern

```
COLLABORATE (Universal Applicative)
    ⊗
Domain Foundations (Roles + Protocols)
    =
Domain Implementation
```

### Foundations by Domain

| Domain | Foundations to Construct | Examples |
|--------|-------------------------|----------|
| **Medicine** | Team roles, handoff protocols, communication standards | Surgeon/anesthesiologist roles, SBAR protocol |
| **Business** | Department roles, meeting cadence, reporting | Sales/marketing roles, weekly syncs, dashboards |
| **Software** | Service boundaries, API contracts, event schemas | **CC2.0 provides**: Agent protocols, message schemas |
| **Manufacturing** | Station roles, quality gates, inventory handoffs | Assembly stations, inspection points, JIT delivery |
| **Education** | Teacher roles, curriculum alignment, assessment sharing | Subject specialists, standards mapping, grade sync |
| **Science** | Lab roles, data protocols, authorship guidelines | PI/postdoc roles, data formats, co-authorship |
| **Law** | Attorney roles, document sharing, privilege protocols | Lead/co-counsel, discovery sharing, privilege logs |
| **Architecture** | Discipline roles, drawing coordination, change orders | Architect/engineer, BIM coordination, RFIs |

*"To collaborate is to transform individual effort into collective achievement, to bridge isolation and coordination. COLLABORATE is the applicative that makes parallel work convergent."*
