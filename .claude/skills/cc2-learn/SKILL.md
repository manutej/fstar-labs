## The Eternal Function

**Universal Question**: *How do we improve?*

This function captures the timeless human activity of learning from experience. Across all domains and eras, humans observe outcomes, extract lessons, and adapt future behavior. LEARN is the bridge from "what happened" to "what we'll do better next time."

### Universality Across Domains

| Domain | LEARN Applies To | Core Operation |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Medicine** | Clinical case review, adverse event analysis, outcome studies | Learn from patient outcomes to improve treatment protocols |
| **Business** | Post-mortems, retrospectives, market feedback analysis | Learn from results to refine strategy, process, execution |
| **Science** | Experimental analysis, peer review, replication studies | Learn from results to improve methodology, theory |
| **Education** | Student assessment analysis, pedagogy reflection, curriculum review | Learn from learning outcomes to improve teaching |
| **Manufacturing** | Root cause analysis, process optimization, defect review | Learn from production data to improve quality, efficiency |
| **Software** | Code review, incident post-mortems, A/B test analysis | Learn from bugs, outages, metrics to improve code, architecture |
| **Law** | Case outcome analysis, jury feedback, appellate decisions | Learn from verdicts to improve arguments, strategy |
| **Architecture** | Post-occupancy evaluation, building performance, user feedback | Learn from usage to improve future designs |

### The Universal Pattern

```
Past Outcomes → Profunctor Learning → Improved Future Behavior
 (Experience)  →  (Adapt + Refine)   →    (Better Practice)
```

**Historical Precedent**:
- **Ancient Medicine**: Hippocratic case studies (400 BCE)
- **Military**: After-action reviews (500s BCE)
- **Industrial**: Continuous improvement / Kaizen (1950s)
- **Software**: Agile retrospectives (2001)

The function is eternal; the learning mechanisms change.

### Why This Works Universally

1. **Profunctor Structure**: Contravariant input adaptation, covariant output refinement
2. **Bidirectional**: Learn from successes AND failures
3. **Compositional**: Learning from learning (meta-learning)
4. **Cumulative**: Knowledge compounds over iterations

Medical case review = Software retrospective. Same structure, different domain knowledge.

## When to Use This Skill

- 📚 **Extract lessons** - Analyze outcomes to identify improvements
- 🔄 **Adapt strategies** - Update approaches based on feedback
- 📊 **Identify patterns** - Detect recurring success/failure modes
- 🎯 **Refine practices** - Improve future performance systematically
- 🧠 **Build knowledge** - Accumulate domain expertise over time

## Building Foundations for Your Domain

**Universal Function = Eternal Structure + Domain Foundations**

LEARN is an eternal categorical structure (Profunctor). To use it in YOUR domain, construct **domain foundations** - review protocols, knowledge repositories, and feedback loops.

### The Pattern

```
LEARN (Universal Profunctor)
    ⊗
Domain Foundations (Reviews + Repositories)
    =
Domain Implementation
```

### Foundations by Domain

| Domain | Foundations to Construct | Examples |
|--------|-------------------------|----------|
| **Medicine** | Case review protocols, adverse event databases, outcome registries | M&M conferences, FDA MAUDE, clinical registries |
| **Business** | Retrospective formats, lessons learned databases, metrics | Sprint retros, CRM insights, KPI dashboards |
| **Software** | Post-mortem templates, incident databases, A/B frameworks | **CC2.0 provides**: Retro templates, incident logs |
| **Manufacturing** | RCA procedures, CAPA systems, SPC databases | 5-whys, corrective actions, control charts |
| **Education** | Assessment analysis, reflection journals, curriculum reviews | Item analysis, teacher journals, program reviews |
| **Science** | Lab notebooks, literature review, replication protocols | Electronic notebooks, systematic reviews, registries |
| **Law** | Case databases, trial notebooks, outcome tracking | Westlaw, trial prep systems, verdict analysis |
| **Architecture** | POE protocols, performance databases, user feedback | Building evaluations, energy data, occupant surveys |

*"To learn is to transform experience into wisdom, to bridge past and future. LEARN is the profunctor from outcome to improvement, the bidirectional adaptation that makes progress possible."*
