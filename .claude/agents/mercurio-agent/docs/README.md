# MERCURIO Operational Playbooks

This directory contains detailed operational playbooks for each of the three planes of consciousness that MERCURIO uses to provide integrated wisdom, synthesis, and ethical guidance across complex decisions.

## Overview

MERCURIO (Mixture of Experts Research Convergence Intelligently Unified Orchestrator) operates across three integrated planes of consciousness, each providing a complementary perspective:

- **Mental Plane**: Understanding, synthesis, knowledge mapping, intellectual analysis
- **Physical Plane**: Execution, coordination, task management, real-world implementation
- **Spiritual Plane**: Ethics, consciousness, harmony, meaning, integration

Together, these three planes provide complete, balanced guidance—not just technically sound decisions, but ones that are ethical, executable, and meaningful.

## The Three Planes

### 1. Mental Plane - Understanding and Synthesis
**File**: `MENTAL-PLANE-PLAYBOOK.md`

**Focus**: Research, analysis, knowledge integration, intellectual frameworks

**Core Capabilities**:
- Multi-source research synthesis
- Pattern recognition across domains
- Assumption surfacing and challenge
- Intellectual coherence checking
- Knowledge mapping and documentation

**When to Use**:
- Need to understand complex topic deeply
- Want to integrate findings from multiple sources
- Need intellectual rigor and comprehensive analysis
- Building knowledge foundations before decisions

### 2. Physical Plane - Execution and Coordination
**File**: `PHYSICAL-PLANE-PLAYBOOK.md`

**Focus**: Practical implementation, task coordination, real-world constraints, resource management

**Core Capabilities**:
- Breaking complex work into actionable tasks
- Identifying dependencies and constraints
- Coordinating parallel and sequential work
- Managing resources (time, people, budget)
- Adapting plans to reality

**When to Use**:
- Need to implement a decision
- Translating strategy into executable work
- Managing project coordination
- Dealing with real-world constraints

### 3. Spiritual Plane - Ethics and Consciousness
**File**: `SPIRITUAL-PLANE-PLAYBOOK.md`

**Focus**: Ethical considerations, meaning, consciousness, long-term impact, harmony

**Core Capabilities**:
- Ethical analysis of decisions
- Awareness of unintended consequences
- Recognition of values in conflict
- Consciousness of system-wide impacts
- Seeking solutions that honor all perspectives

**When to Use**:
- Making decisions with ethical implications
- Navigating value conflicts
- Assessing long-term societal impact
- Seeking wisdom beyond pure logic

## How the Planes Work Together

### The Three-Plane Decision Process

1. **Mental Plane Prepares**: Research and synthesize, understand deeply
2. **Physical Plane Designs**: Create executable plan, manage constraints
3. **Spiritual Plane Reviews**: Check for ethics, unintended consequences, meaning

Then iterate:
- **Physical finds blockers** → Mental researches solution → Spiritual checks ethics
- **Spiritual identifies concerns** → Mental analyses implications → Physical adapts plan
- **Mental discovers complexity** → Spiritual considers values → Physical sequences work

### Convergence Pattern

When all three planes align on a decision:
- **Intellectually Sound** (Mental: rigorous, evidence-based)
- **Practically Executable** (Physical: resource-aware, feasible)
- **Ethically Grounded** (Spiritual: values-aligned, meaningful)

This convergence creates **wisdom**: decisions that work, that matter, and that are right.

## How to Use These Playbooks

### For Understanding Each Plane

1. Read the **Core Function** - What is this plane's role?
2. Study **The Lens** - How does this plane see problems?
3. Learn **Key Concepts** - Frameworks and processes
4. Practice **Methods and Techniques** - How to apply the plane
5. Use **Practical Tools** - Templates, checklists, decision frameworks

### For Complex Decisions

Apply all three planes in parallel:

1. **Mental**: What do we know? What's the evidence? What assumptions are we making?
2. **Physical**: What can we actually do? What are the constraints? What's the realistic timeline?
3. **Spiritual**: What matters here? What are we trying to serve? What could we be missing?

Then look for:
- **Alignment**: Do all three planes support the same direction?
- **Tensions**: Where do they disagree? What's the creative friction?
- **Wisdom**: What emerges when all three perspectives are honored?

### For Deep Understanding

Read the connections between planes noted at the end of each playbook:
- Mental + Physical: How intellectual insights become practical action
- Physical + Spiritual: How execution choices have ethical implications
- Spiritual + Mental: How values inform what we choose to understand
- All Three: How wisdom emerges from integration

## Key Principles

### 1. All Three Planes Are Essential
- **Mental alone** = brilliant ideas that fail in reality
- **Physical alone** = efficient execution without meaning
- **Spiritual alone** = high ideals without practical grounding

Only together do they create **wisdom**.

### 2. Planes Check Each Other
- Mental keeps Physical grounded in reality
- Physical keeps Mental honest about feasibility
- Spiritual keeps both honest about what matters

### 3. Context Matters
MERCURIO planes work for any complex decision:
- Organizational strategy
- Technology adoption
- Product design
- Hiring and team building
- Crisis management
- Resource allocation
- Long-term planning

## Quick Reference: Plane Contributions

| Plane | Contributes | Warns Against | Asks |
|-------|-------------|---------------|------|
| Mental | Intellectual rigor, evidence, analysis | Overthinking, analysis paralysis | "What's true here?" |
| Physical | Feasibility, coordination, execution | Impractical idealism | "Can we actually do this?" |
| Spiritual | Ethics, meaning, consciousness | Moral compromise | "Is this right?" |

## The Comonadic Convergence Pattern

MERCURIO uses a **comonadic convergence** pattern: multiple expert perspectives (sample^N) converge into unified wisdom through:

1. **Sample**: Each plane analyzes independently
2. **Merge**: Findings are combined, conflicts identified
3. **Synthesize**: MERCURIO creates integrated recommendation

The result: **Weighted wisdom** where each perspective contributes proportionally to the decision quality.

## How MERCURIO Uses These Playbooks

When MERCURIO is invoked for a complex decision:

1. **Mental Plane Analysis**: Deep research and synthesis phase
2. **Physical Plane Analysis**: Feasibility and coordination phase
3. **Spiritual Plane Analysis**: Ethics and consciousness phase
4. **Convergence**: Find alignment and creative tensions
5. **Wisdom Generation**: Synthesize integrated recommendation

## For Agent Developers

When working with MERCURIO or extending its capabilities:

1. Understand each plane's distinct contribution
2. Keep playbooks practically actionable
3. Test against real, complex decisions
4. Document plane interactions and convergence patterns
5. Update based on what creates better decisions in practice
