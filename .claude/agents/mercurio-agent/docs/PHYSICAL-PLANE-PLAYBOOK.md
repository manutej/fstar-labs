# MERCURIO: Physical Plane Playbook

**Plane**: Physical - Execution, Coordination, Real-World Implementation
**Agent**: MERCURIO
**Usage**: Reference during planning, coordination, and implementation phases

---

## Core Question

"Can we actually do this? What does execution require? How do we coordinate across domains?"

---

## The Physical Lens

### What MERCURIO's Physical Plane Looks For

- **Feasibility**: Is this possible given constraints?
- **Resources**: What people, time, budget, tools are needed?
- **Dependencies**: What must happen first? What blocks progress?
- **Sequencing**: What's the right order of work?
- **Coordination**: How do different teams/domains stay aligned?
- **Adaptation**: How do we respond when reality differs from plan?
- **Obstacles**: What could derail execution? How do we mitigate?

---

## Core Function

The Physical Plane translates **strategy into action**—taking intellectual understanding and turning it into real, coordinated work that produces results in the actual world.

### What the Physical Plane Does

1. **Tests feasibility** against real constraints
2. **Breaks work down** into concrete tasks
3. **Identifies dependencies** and sequencing
4. **Allocates resources** (time, people, budget)
5. **Coordinates execution** across domains
6. **Adapts to reality** as it unfolds
7. **Removes obstacles** blocking progress
8. **Manages risk** through preparation

### What the Physical Plane Does NOT Do

- Decide what's true (that's the Mental Plane's job)
- Judge whether something is ethical (that's the Spiritual Plane)
- Get attached to the original plan (adapts when reality changes)
- Overlook constraints (faces them head-on)

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Feasibility vs Desirability

**Not everything desirable is feasible.**

The Physical Plane distinguishes:
- **Desirable**: We want this, it would be good to have
- **Feasible**: We can actually do this given our constraints
- **Viable**: Worth doing given the effort required

```
High desirability + Low feasibility = Dream without execution
High feasibility + Low desirability = Pointless work
High on both = Worth doing
```

### 2. The Constraint Triangle

Every project faces three constraints:

```
       Quality
       /     \
      /       \
     /         \
 Scope -------- Timeline
              Budget
```

Can't optimize all three. Trade-offs are unavoidable. The Physical Plane makes these explicit.

### 3. Realistic Timeline Estimation

The Physical Plane knows:
- **Optimistic estimate**: If everything goes right (usually too low)
- **Realistic estimate**: Accounting for normal obstacles
- **Pessimistic estimate**: If bad luck strikes

Rule of thumb: **Realistic = Optimistic × 1.5 to 2.5**

### 4. Dependency Mapping

Complex work has dependencies:

```
Task A must finish before Task B can start (sequential)
Task A and B can happen simultaneously (parallel)
Task B depends on output from Task A (data dependency)
Task A and B share resource (resource constraint)
```

The Physical Plane maps these ruthlessly.

### 5. Coordination Overhead

More teams = more coordination needed

```
1 team: No coordination needed
2 teams: One handoff point
3 teams: Three handoff points
N teams: N(N-1)/2 potential communication channels
```

The Physical Plane accounts for coordination cost.

### 6. The Buffer Principle

Always build in buffers for:
- **Time**: Unexpected obstacles always occur
- **People**: Someone will get sick, leave, have conflicting priorities
- **Money**: Scope creep and surprises cost more than expected
- **Knowledge**: You won't know everything needed upfront

## Processes and Methods

### Method 1: Feasibility Assessment

**Process**:
```
1. State what we want to do
2. List all constraints:
   - Budget available
   - Timeline available
   - People available
   - Technical constraints
   - Regulatory/policy constraints
   - External dependencies
3. For each constraint, ask:
   - How tight is this constraint?
   - Can it be relaxed? At what cost?
   - What would be impossible if this constraint held?
4. Synthesize: Is this feasible as stated?
5. If not, what would need to change?
```

**Template**:
```
Plan: [What we want to do]

Constraint 1: [Name]
- Actual limit: [What we have]
- Needed: [What plan requires]
- Feasible?: Yes/No/With adjustment
- Cost to relax: [If applicable]

Result: [Feasible/Needs modification/Impossible]
If needs modification: [What has to change]
```

### Method 2: Work Breakdown Structure

**Process**:
```
1. Start with the goal (very high level)
2. Break into major phases
3. Break each phase into workstreams
4. Break each workstream into tasks
5. Estimate time for each task
6. Identify dependencies between tasks
7. Sequence the work
8. Allocate people/resources to tasks
```

**Example**:
```
Goal: Launch new product in 6 months

Phase 1: Foundation (Month 1)
├─ Product requirements (2 weeks)
├─ Market research (2 weeks)
└─ Resource planning (1 week)

Phase 2: Build (Months 2-4)
├─ Engineering workstream
│  ├─ Architecture design (2 weeks)
│  ├─ Core development (6 weeks)
│  └─ Testing (3 weeks)
├─ Product design workstream
│  ├─ User research (2 weeks)
│  ├─ Design (4 weeks)
│  └─ Iteration (2 weeks)
└─ GTM workstream
   ├─ Message development (2 weeks)
   ├─ Channel setup (2 weeks)
   └─ Sales prep (2 weeks)

Phase 3: Launch (Month 5)
├─ Final testing (1 week)
├─ Marketing launch (1 week)
└─ Sales launch (1 week)

Phase 4: Sustain (Month 6+)
├─ Customer support (ongoing)
├─ Monitoring (ongoing)
└─ Iteration (ongoing)
```

### Method 3: Dependency Mapping

**Process**:
```
1. List all tasks
2. For each task, identify:
   - What tasks must complete before this starts?
   - What tasks depend on this task's output?
   - What resources/people does this need?
   - What could go wrong?
3. Create dependency graph:
   - Sequential chains (must happen in order)
   - Parallel groups (can happen simultaneously)
   - Critical path (longest chain determines timeline)
4. Optimize:
   - What can be parallelized?
   - What's the minimum viable timeline?
   - Where are the bottlenecks?
```

**Template**:
```
Task: [What needs to happen]
Duration: [How long it takes]
Prerequisites: [What must complete first]
Dependencies: [What depends on this]
Resources needed: [People, budget, tools]
Critical?: [Is this on critical path?]
```

### Method 4: Resource Planning

**Process**:
```
1. List all tasks (from work breakdown)
2. For each task:
   - What skills are needed?
   - How many people?
   - For how long?
   - Full-time or part-time?
3. Map against available people
4. Identify:
   - What's over-allocated?
   - What skills are missing?
   - What's the bottleneck resource?
5. Options for gaps:
   - Hire/bring in contractors
   - Extend timeline
   - Reduce scope
   - Reorganize work
```

**Resource Matrix Template**:
```
      | Person 1 | Person 2 | Person 3 |
------|----------|----------|----------|
Task A|   100%   |          |          |
Task B|   50%    |   50%    |          |
Task C|          |          |   100%   |
------|----------|----------|----------|
Total |   150%   |   50%    |   100%   |
```

Over-allocation = resource constraint

### Method 5: Risk Mitigation Planning

**Process**:
```
1. Brainstorm what could go wrong:
   - Technical risks (technology doesn't work)
   - Resource risks (people leave, budget cuts)
   - Dependency risks (external partner delays)
   - Unknown risks (unknown unknowns)
2. For each risk:
   - Probability: How likely?
   - Impact: How bad if it happens?
   - Detection: How would we know?
   - Mitigation: What can we do proactively?
   - Contingency: What do we do if it happens?
3. Prioritize: Focus on high-probability, high-impact risks
4. Build in buffers to handle:
   - The risks we identified
   - The risks we didn't foresee
```

**Risk Register Template**:
```
Risk: [What could go wrong]
Probability: [High/Medium/Low]
Impact: [High/Medium/Low]
Detection: [How would we know?]
Mitigation: [What we do to prevent it]
Contingency: [What we do if it happens]
Owner: [Who's responsible for managing this]
```

### Method 6: Adaptive Planning

**Process**:
```
1. Start with realistic plan
2. Set review cycles:
   - How often will we check progress?
   - What metrics tell us if we're on track?
   - When will we adjust course?
3. Build in decision points:
   - "If X happens, we'll do Y instead"
   - "If we fall 2 weeks behind, we'll reduce scope"
   - "If technical blockers appear, we'll pivot to Z"
4. Track and adjust:
   - Compare actual to plan
   - Understand variances
   - Adjust remaining plan based on learning
5. Continuous improvement:
   - What's going better than expected?
   - What's going worse?
   - What should we do differently next time?
```

**Adaptive Decision Template**:
```
Scenario: [What condition triggers this decision]
Current plan would: [What we planned to do]
Alternative: [What we'd do instead]
Trigger: [What metric or event triggers decision]
Decision point: [When do we need to decide?]
Owner: [Who decides?]
```

## When MERCURIO Uses the Physical Plane

### In Project Planning
"What does it take to actually do this?"

### In Resource Allocation
"Who needs to do what? In what order?"

### In Risk Management
"What could go wrong? How do we prepare?"

### In Execution Monitoring
"Are we on track? What needs adjustment?"

### In Adaptation
"Reality has changed. How does our plan change?"

### In Coordination
"How do different teams stay aligned during execution?"

---

## Connection to Other Planes

### Physical + Mental
The Physical Plane depends on Mental's understanding.
The Mental Plane depends on Physical's reality-testing.

**Challenge**: Perfect plans that can't be executed
**Resolution**: Mental researches deeply, Physical tests feasibility, collaborate

### Physical + Spiritual
The Physical Plane executes the work.
The Spiritual Plane ensures the work serves what matters.

**Challenge**: Executing work that's technically sound but ethically problematic
**Resolution**: Physical identifies what can be done, Spiritual identifies what should be done, collaborate

### All Three Together
**Mental** provides: Understanding (what's true)
**Physical** provides: Execution (what's doable)
**Spiritual** provides: Purpose (what matters)

Together they create **wisdom**: Truth + Action + Meaning

---

## Advanced Patterns

### Progressive Elaboration

Start with rough plan, refine over time:

```
Week 1: High-level roadmap (phases, milestones, rough timeline)
Week 2: Workstream planning (team structure, major work items)
Week 3: Detailed task planning (specific tasks, dependencies)
Week 4: Resource and risk planning (who does what, what could go wrong)
Ongoing: Continuous refinement as learning occurs
```

### Managing Competing Constraints

Often impossible to optimize all constraints. The Physical Plane makes explicit choices:

```
Option 1: Full scope, over budget, on timeline
Option 2: Full scope, in budget, over timeline
Option 3: Reduced scope, in budget, on timeline

Decision: Which tradeoff serves our goals?
```

### Cross-Functional Coordination

Complex projects require multiple teams. The Physical Plane ensures they:
- Understand shared goal
- Know their dependencies
- Have clear communication
- Can escalate and resolve conflicts
- Update each other regularly

### Contingency Planning

For high-impact risks, plan what you'd do if it happens:

```
Risk: Key person leaves
Contingency: Cross-training plan, documentation, backup person identified

Risk: Technology doesn't work
Contingency: Alternative approach planned, prototyped early

Risk: Budget gets cut
Contingency: Prioritized scope, can reduce features
```

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Over-Planning
Planning for every possible scenario until nothing happens

**Prevention**:
- Set planning horizon (plan in detail 4 weeks out, less detail beyond)
- Start execution while still planning
- Use rolling-wave planning

### 2. Ignoring Constraints
Pretending constraints don't exist

**Prevention**:
- Face constraints head-on
- Make explicit trade-offs
- If constraints can't be met, escalate or reduce scope

### 3. False Timeline Precision
"We'll ship on March 15 at 2:37 PM"

**Prevention**:
- Use ranges and buffers
- Distinguish between phases and dates
- Build in contingency

### 4. Coordination Theater
Lots of meetings that don't improve coordination

**Prevention**:
- Clear purpose for each meeting
- Only attendees who need to be there
- Decisions and actions come out
- Async updates when possible

### 5. Plan/Reality Divergence
Plan becomes divorced from actual execution

**Prevention**:
- Review plan monthly against reality
- Update plan based on learning
- Everyone uses same plan (not hidden plans)
- Celebrate when reality beats plan

## Summary: Physical Plane in Action

The Physical Plane provides **operational grounding**—translating understanding into action, managing constraints, coordinating work, and adapting as reality unfolds.

It does this by:
- ✅ Testing feasibility against real constraints
- ✅ Breaking work into concrete tasks
- ✅ Identifying dependencies and sequencing
- ✅ Allocating resources appropriately
- ✅ Managing risk proactively
- ✅ Coordinating execution
- ✅ Adapting to actual conditions

The Physical Plane's gift to wisdom: **How do we actually execute this?**
