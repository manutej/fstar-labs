# MARS Operational Playbooks

This directory contains detailed operational playbooks for each of the six dimensions that MARS uses to analyze complex, multi-domain problems.

## Overview

MARS (Multi-Agent Research Synthesis) operates across six integrated dimensions simultaneously. Each dimension provides a specific lens for understanding problems and designing solutions.

## The Six Dimensions

1. **Structural Dimension** - Domain organization, dependencies, integration points
2. **Causal Dimension** - Leverage points, feedback loops, cascade effects, tipping points
3. **Epistemic Dimension** - Knowledge gaps, hidden assumptions, paradigm blindness, constraints
4. **Temporal Dimension** - Timing, phasing, emergence, delays, irreversibility
5. **Cultural Dimension** - Narratives, values, meaning, identity, resistance
6. **Integrative Dimension** - Coherence, paradoxes, self-correction, system optimization

## How to Use These Playbooks

### For Understanding Each Dimension

1. Read the **Core Question** - What is this dimension asking?
2. Study **The Lens** - What does this dimension see that others miss?
3. Learn **Key Concepts** - Foundational frameworks and ideas
4. Practice **Processes and Methods** - How to apply the dimension
5. Use **Practical Tools** - Templates, checklists, examples

### For Analyzing a Problem

Start with the **Structural Dimension** (understand domains and dependencies), then move through Epistemic → Causal → Temporal → Cultural → Integrative.

### For Designing a Solution

Check your solution against all six dimensions using the provided templates. A good solution satisfies all six simultaneously.

### For Deepest Understanding

Read the connections between dimensions noted at the end of each playbook. The magic happens at the intersections:
- Structural + Causal: How structure enables or blocks leverage
- Epistemic + Causal: Hidden assumptions about what causes what
- Temporal + Cultural: How culture shift requires time, and time requires culture
- etc.

## Key Principles

### 1. Dimensions Work Simultaneously
Don't apply dimensions sequentially. Apply all six in parallel, looking for:
- **Coherence**: Do all dimensions point in same direction?
- **Tensions**: Are there creative tensions between dimensions? (Usually yes, and usually productive)
- **Emergence**: What system properties appear when all dimensions are integrated?

### 2. Playbooks Provide Concrete Guidance
Each playbook includes:
- Real-world examples
- Step-by-step processes
- Analysis templates (copy into your problem documentation)
- Common pitfalls
- Connection diagrams

### 3. Context Matters
MARS dimensions work for any bounded system:
- Organizational transformations
- Product launches
- Supply chain redesigns
- Manufacturing operations
- Software development
- Emergency services
- Government operations
- Any complex, multi-domain challenge

## Quick Reference: When Each Dimension Is Critical

| Dimension | Critical When | Look For |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Structural | Designing organization | Domain mapping, dependencies, silos |
| Epistemic | Starting analysis | Hidden assumptions, unknown unknowns |
| Causal | Identifying interventions | Leverage points, feedback loops |
| Temporal | Creating timeline | Realistic duration, emergence points |
| Cultural | Ensuring adoption | Narrative, meaning, identity shifts |
| Integrative | Final validation | Coherence, paradox resolution |

## How MARS Uses These Playbooks

When MARS is invoked for a problem:

1. **Decomposition Phase**: Use Structural dimension to identify domains
2. **Analysis Phase**: Use appropriate dimensions to understand each domain
3. **Synthesis Phase**: Use Integrative dimension to find coherence
4. **Reality Testing Phase**: Use all dimensions to validate blueprint
5. **Implementation Planning**: Use Temporal and Cultural dimensions for change management

## For Agent Developers

When extending or updating MARS:

1. Understand how all six dimensions relate
2. Ensure playbooks remain practically actionable
3. Test playbooks against real problems
4. Update based on what works in practice
5. Document connection patterns that emerge
