# MARS: Cultural Dimension Playbook

**Dimension**: What people value, what sustains commitment, what creates meaning
**Agent**: MARS
**Usage**: Reference during culture design, narrative work, and engagement planning

---

## Core Question
"Why would people care about this? What meaning makes them want to sustain effort?"

---

## The Cultural Lens

### What MARS Looks For
- **Narratives**: What stories are being told? What story wants to emerge?
- **Values**: What matters to stakeholders? Where do values conflict?
- **Identity**: How do people see themselves? Who do they need to become?
- **Meaning**: Does work connect to purpose? Why should people care?
- **Rituals**: What celebrates progress? What marks transitions?
- **Resistance**: Where's the emotional push-back? Why?

---

## Current Narrative vs Possible Narrative

### Understanding Narratives

**What is a narrative?**
The story organization tells about itself and its work

**Why it matters**:
- People sustain effort for meaning, not just strategy
- Narrative creates that meaning
- Different narrative → Different behavior
- Same blueprint with different narrative → Different success

### Identifying Current Narrative

**How to listen**:
1. **Ask people**: "What's our story? What are we about?"
2. **Watch their words**: Metaphors, recurring phrases, heroes
3. **Notice what's missing**: What don't people talk about?
4. **Identify contradictions**: What's said vs actually valued?

### Current Narrative Examples

```
NARRATIVE 1: "We're a stable, reliable company"
└─ Behavior: Conservative, risk-averse, slow to change
   Problem: Can't innovate, slow to market

NARRATIVE 2: "We're struggling to survive"
└─ Behavior: Defensive, resource-hoarding, short-term focus
   Problem: No vision, exhausting

NARRATIVE 3: "We're a family"
└─ Behavior: Loyalty, mutual support, sometimes tribal
   Problem: Can exclude outsiders, avoid hard feedback

NARRATIVE 4: "We're fighting the good fight"
└─ Behavior: Passionate, committed, sometimes burnt out
   Problem: Sustainability issues, martyr mentality
```

### Possible Future Narratives

**Question**: "What story could we tell that would inspire commitment?"

```
FROM: "Stable company following proven methods"
TO: "Learning organization that adapts to change"
└─ New behavior: Experimentation, continuous improvement, growth mindset

FROM: "We're struggling to survive"
TO: "We're building something that matters"
└─ New behavior: Hope, longer-term thinking, strategic

FROM: "Work is burden we must bear"
TO: "Work is where we create value and matter"
└─ New behavior: Engagement, innovation, meaning

FROM: "Hierarchy controls everything"
TO: "Distributed leadership, people own their work"
└─ New behavior: Agency, responsibility, initiative
```

### Shifting Narrative

**Not about**: Propaganda, spin, corporate messaging
**Actually about**: Honest story of what's becoming possible

**Process**:
1. **Acknowledge the current story** (what's true about it?)
2. **Recognize its limits** (what doesn't it explain?)
3. **Show evidence** of emerging new story (who's already doing this?)
4. **Name the new possibility** (here's what's becoming true)
5. **Invite people in** (will you help create this?)

---

## Values and Value Conflicts

### Identifying Values

**What people actually value** (not stated values, but revealed through choices):
```
How do people spend time?
What do they protect?
What makes them angry when violated?
What do they sacrifice for?
What would they quit over?
```

### Common Organizational Values

```
STAKEHOLDER VALUES:

Customers:
- Quality, reliability, responsiveness
- Fair price, good value
- Treated with respect
- Their problem is solved

Employees:
- Fair compensation
- Respect, autonomy, growth
- Meaningful work
- Community, belonging
- Career advancement

Shareholders/Owners:
- Financial return
- Risk management
- Growth
- Competitive advantage

Community/Society:
- Jobs, stability
- Environmental stewardship
- Ethical practices
- Contribution to society
```

### Value Conflicts

**Common conflicts**:
```
Profit vs Purpose
├─ Shareholders want return
├─ Employees want meaningful work
└─ Customers want good value

Short-term vs Long-term
├─ Investors want quarterly results
├─ Leaders want sustainable business
└─ Communities want long-term stability

Individual vs Collective
├─ People want autonomy
├─ Organization needs coordination
└─ Teams need clear boundaries

Growth vs Sustainability
├─ Investors want growth
├─ Environment wants sustainability
└─ Employees want workable pace
```

### MARS Approach: Alignment or Honest Trade-offs

**Option 1: Genuine Alignment**
```
Find goal that serves all values:
"We grow AND build sustainably AND support people"
"We're profitable AND meaningful AND good for community"

Often possible when you dig deep enough.
```

**Option 2: Honest Trade-offs**
```
"To achieve X, we must trade Y"
Be honest about the trade
Help people understand why it's worth it
Listen to whether they agree
```

**Avoid**: Pretending values aren't in conflict (people see through it)

---

## Identity and Identity Shift

### The Identity Dimension

**How people see themselves** shapes what they do:

```
IDENTITY: "I'm a machine operator"
└─ Behavior: Follow instructions, do assigned tasks
   Problem: No improvement, just execution

IDENTITY: "I'm a quality guardian"
└─ Behavior: Catch problems, improve processes
   Problem: Might slow production

IDENTITY: "I'm a problem-solver"
└─ Behavior: Identify and solve issues, continuous improvement
   Result: Engaged, innovative, improving work

IDENTITY: "I'm part of something bigger"
└─ Behavior: Care about organization's success
   Result: Commitment beyond job description
```

### Identity Shift Requirements

For people to shift identity:
1. **Safety to try new identity**
   - Won't be punished for trying
   - Support for learning new role

2. **Role models showing new identity**
   - People who embody it
   - Visible, respected people

3. **Repeated practice**
   - Doing the new identity, over and over
   - Until it becomes natural

4. **Recognition**
   - Celebrated for embodying new identity
   - Affirmed when acting from new place

5. **Structural support**
   - Systems, rules, processes align
   - Old way made hard, new way made easy

---

## Meaning and Purpose Alignment

### The Meaning Question
"Why should people care? What does this work serve?"

### Purpose Levels

```
TRANSACTIONAL:
"Do this job, get paid"
└─ People will show up, but no discretionary effort

PROFESSIONAL:
"Do this work with excellence"
└─ People care about quality, but limited engagement

MISSION:
"Help customers solve their problems"
└─ People are engaged, aligned with purpose

TRANSCENDENT:
"Change the world / Make life better / Create something that matters"
└─ People sustain effort, meaning sustains them
```

### Connecting Work to Meaning

**Process**:
1. **Name the real impact**
   - What does this work actually enable?
   - Who benefits? How?
   - What becomes possible?

2. **Show the connection**
   - Daily work ↔ Real impact
   - "Your coding" ↔ "People have better healthcare"
   - "Your manufacturing" ↔ "Families have reliable products"

3. **Make it visible**
   - Customer stories (here's whose life you changed)
   - Impact metrics (here's how much you're helping)
   - Site visits (meet the people you serve)

4. **Celebrate the impact**
   - Recognize contributions to purpose
   - Share stories of lives improved
   - Make meaning visible regularly

## Rituals and Symbols

### The Power of Ritual

Ritual marks moments, creates memory, sustains meaning

**Types of rituals**:
```
TRANSITION RITUALS:
└─ Mark change from old way to new way
   Example: "Retiring the old process" ceremony
   Why: People need to say goodbye to old, hello to new

ACHIEVEMENT RITUALS:
└─ Celebrate progress, reinforce identity
   Example: Monthly "what we learned" meeting
   Why: Marks progress, celebrates learning

CONNECTION RITUALS:
└─ Build community, belonging
   Example: Team lunch, standup meetings, retrospectives
   Why: Creates bonds, shared identity

RENEWAL RITUALS:
└─ Refresh commitment, reset focus
   Example: Quarterly planning, annual review
   Why: Keeps work from becoming rote
```

### Creating Meaningful Rituals

**Effective rituals**:
- Have clear meaning (why do this?)
- Involve people (not imposed)
- Repeated regularly (consistency)
- Connect to values (embody what matters)
- Mark something important (transition, achievement, connection)

**Example: Monthly Learning Ceremony**
```
Frequency: Monthly, same day/time
Participants: All interested
Duration: 1 hour
Structure:
├─ Reflection: What did we learn this month?
├─ Story: Someone shares a learning or success
├─ Recognition: Celebrate problem-solving, innovation
└─ Commitment: What will we improve next month?

Why it works:
├─ Marks learning as valued
├─ Creates connection across teams
├─ Builds identity as learning organization
└─ Visible progress on improvement
```

## Understanding Resistance

### Resistance Isn't Opposition

**Resistance comes from**:
- Fear (will I be okay in new situation?)
- Loss (what am I giving up?)
- Confusion (I don't understand why)
- Powerlessness (it's being done TO me)
- Values conflict (this violates what I care about)
- Legitimate concerns (this might not work)

### Listening to Resistance

**Method**: Don't override, understand:
```
"I hear you saying X won't work.
Tell me more about your concern."

Listen for:
├─ Real obstacles (worth addressing)
├─ Legitimate worries (address concerns)
├─ Values conflicts (acknowledge them)
└─ Expertise (their experience matters)
```

### Working With Resistance

**Not**: "Get over it, this is happening"
(Creates bigger resistance)

**Yes**: "I understand this feels risky.
Here's how we'll mitigate the risk.
Your concerns matter, and here's how we address them."
(Transforms resistance into partnership)

## Connection to Other Dimensions

**Cultural + Structural**:
"This structure embodiesour values OR violates them"

**Cultural + Causal**:
"This cultural shift creates positive feedback loops"

**Cultural + Temporal**:
"Culture shift takes time; people need meaning to sustain during wait"

**Cultural + Epistemic**:
"What assumptions about human nature underlie our culture?"

**Cultural + Integrative**:
"Do all our cultural elements point in same direction OR are they fragmented?"
